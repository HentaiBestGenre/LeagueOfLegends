# LeagueOfLegends
The project is a try to create a copy of a popular in League of Legends community website https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/
Beck-end was created with Django framework and consist of 3 app(match, summoner, main) 
I decided do not use any librarys for working with RiotAPI like Riot-Watcher or cassiopeia and created my own API.
The whole application is asynchronous, course it shoud make a lot of requests into RiotAPI
